                 I developed a strong passion for web development and cloud technology at a young age. 
                 Drawing from my technical background, I chose to pursue this field and enrolled in college to deepen my knowledge. 
                 Now equipped with a considerable skill set, I have decided to venture into freelance web development.

                 I became fascinated with home automation at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spending more time at home made me realize the potential for technology to enhance our daily lives. 
                 I eagerly explored smart devices, IoT technologies, and innovative solutions. This newfound passion has driven me to incorporate home automation into my professional pursuits.
